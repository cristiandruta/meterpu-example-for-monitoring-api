# Example code for integration of MeterPU and monitoring-api

> Written in C++ and CUDA


## Summary

This module includes a minimal example to illustrate the usage of MeterPU to get power samples
and get visualized by ATOM monitoring frameworks. It interfaces with monitoring-api.

## Prerequisites

This example requires CUDA GPUs with energy counter, CUDA 7 or higher, CUDA TDK 5.319.85 or higher, and gcc 4.8.2 or higher.

Before you can proceed, please clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/excess-project/monitoring-api-with-meterpu-example.git
```

### Dependencies

This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

   | Component          | Homepage                                                                                           | Version   | 
   | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | 
   | monitoring-api     | http://curl.haxx.se/                                                                               | >= 16.6   | 
   | Nvidia GDK or TDK  | http://developer.download.nvidia.com//compute/cuda/7.5/Prod/gdk/gdk_linux_amd64_352_55_release.run | >= 352.55 | 


To ease the process of setting up a development environment, we provide a basic
script that downloads all dependencies, installs them locally in the project
directory, and then performs some clean-up operations. Thus, compiling the
monitoring API can be performed in a sandbox without affecting your current
operating system.

Executing the following script

```bash
./setup.sh
```

results in a new directory named monitoring-api and nvidia_gdk, which holds the required dependencies
for compiling the project.


## Installation

This section assumes that you've successfully installed all required dependencies as described in the previous paragraphs.

```bash
$ cd src
$ make
$ make run
$ open url http://mf.excess-project.eu:3000/ to get the visualized data.
```


## Project Structure

A simple example
of how to integrate MeterPU with ATOM monitoring framework is found in the `src` folder. The corresponding
source file is called `main.cu`.
